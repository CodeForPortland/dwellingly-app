## Introduction

Welcome to the JOIN frontend repository. This frontent is built using React and Redux. This repository was originally written to connect with Google's Firebase. The Firebase repository can be found at the [Firebase Messenger DB Repo](https://github.com/AmplifiedHub/join-messenger-db). However, the JOIN backend is currently being rewritten with Flask. The Flask repository can be found at the [Dwellingly Backend Repo](https://github.com/codeforpdx/dwellingly_backend).

This React app is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA) with some modifications that require ejection from the standard CRA framework. Those modifications are listed below. Each title will link to relevant documentation for the technology or guide listed.

- [Node Sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)
- [Firebase integrations](https://firebase.google.com/docs) (authentication, hosting)
  - **Note: Firebase will be removed from the project.**
